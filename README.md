# About the project

  GroceryHub is a in development app to help people save money in grocery purchases all around the world with mutual collaboration

# How does it work

  If you need to purchase a list of items, for example:

  - 3 x Banana
  - 1 x Nescau Cereal
  - 2 x Orange

  Your could create the grocery list using the app and it would automatically search which supermarket has those items, the price, and the supermaket that should be the cheapest for you to buy.

  ### How does the app know the price of each item in the supermaket updated? 

  That is the most important part of the app, _*collaboration*_ !
  In a similar way to [Waze](https://www.waze.com/pt-PT/live-map/), the app expects that you can collaborate to update and add prices for the supermarket when you are there, so if you dont see a product listed in the app of the supermaket you're in or it's out of date, consider contributing to help someone else ðŸ˜Š
